# wayland-egl-icegdl

Wayland EGL

This project provides an implementation of wayland-egl for devices employing Intel CE SOC's such as the CE4200.  A libwayland-egl.so is
generated which extends the EGL provided by the Intel SDK by adding the wayland-egl API's to allow Wayland compositors such as Weston 
and Westeros to run and support Wayland client applications.
